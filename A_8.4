#8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the
# line into a list of words using the split() method. The program should build
#a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already
# in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes,
#sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt

inp = input("Enter file:") #select the file
fh = open(inp) #enter file
lst = list() #making an empty list
for line in fh: #for every line of the file
    word = line.rstrip().split() #cutting off the white space to the right and splitting them into words

    for element in word: #going through each word
        if element in lst: #if the words repeat in the empty list
            continue #do nothing
        else: #if not repeat
            lst.append(element) #then add them to the list
lst.sort() #sort them alphabetically
print(lst) #printing the final list
